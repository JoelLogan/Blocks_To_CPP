# Changelog

All notable changes to Blocks2Cpp are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (0.x until 1.0).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Technical specification, architecture decision records and security policy.
- Specification website published with GitHub Pages.
- Rust workspace with the shared contracts of the compiler pipeline: validated
  IDs, the diagnostics model, injection-safe C++ text encoders, the Semantic AST,
  source maps, the project file model and the milestone-M1 block catalog.
- Project loading with every validation rule of the format, canonical saving
  and content hashing; the block catalog and its resolve stage.
- The analyser: lowering of the 32 milestone-M1 blocks, expression slots,
  scoping, types, flow checks and lints, with 46 documented diagnostics.
- C++ generation: readable, deterministic code with source maps and support
  helpers for random numbers and safe input.
- Toolchain discovery and probing, safe compiler commands and environment,
  and parsing of g++ diagnostics in SARIF, JSON and text.
- Process control that stops whole process trees (process groups on Linux,
  Job Objects on Windows).
- The `b2c` command-line tool: `check`, `generate`, `build`, `run`,
  `toolchains`, `migrate` and `fmt`.
- Fifteen example projects with golden tests, a malicious-project regression
  suite, fuzz targets, and CI on Linux (GCC 11, 13 and 15) and Windows (MSYS2)
  with security scanning.
- The desktop app shell (milestone M0): a Tauri 2 window with an empty Blockly
  canvas (Zelos renderer) and placeholder panels, hardened with the specified
  Content Security Policy, the isolation pattern and minimal capabilities, and
  built and checked in CI on Linux and Windows.
- More CI quality gates: API docs built with warnings denied, Markdown lint,
  an external link check, line-coverage gates (80% for all Rust code, 90% for
  the compiler crates), a size budget for the WebAssembly core, checks that
  generated files are up to date, and fuzz targets for the g++ diagnostics
  parsers, seeded with recorded GCC 11 and GCC 13 output.
- Milestone M2 foundations: the IPC contract between the editor and the
  backend (crate `b2c-ipc`, with generated TypeScript types and an isolation
  allowlist), machine-local settings and recent-project stores, pseudo-terminal
  sessions for running programs (openpty on Linux, ConPTY on Windows), the
  editor's scope query, the WebAssembly core for the live C++ preview, the
  catalog export that generates the toolbox and the block reference, and
  frontend test tooling with coverage and accessibility checks.
- Pasting blocks is validated like opening a file (new codes `B2C-E0138` and
  `B2C-E0139`), and loose block stacks are saved intact (`stack`).
- Nightly fuzzing with a kept corpus, and weekly mutation testing and
  dependency-health reports.
- Desktop editor building blocks (milestone M2): Blockly blocks generated from
  the catalog with Zelos shapes, light and dark themes and custom fields that
  show text literally; a type-aware connection checker and the variadic
  mutators; the app shell (start-up, state store, layout, toolbar, Run gating,
  accessible dialogs); the C++ code panel with source-map highlighting, the
  Problems list, the console and the build output; and build-cache eviction
  (2 GiB limit by default, 30-day pruning, Clear build cache).
